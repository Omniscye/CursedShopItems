# Empress's Cursed Bazaar

> [!NOTE]
> Real-time wave pricing, market chaos, and exploding shelves. A cursed overhaul of MoreShopItems originally by InfusedGalaxy/Jettcodey.
> Full credit for creating the original mod goes to [InfusedGalaxy](https://github.com/InfusedGalaxy) and [Jettcodey](https://github.com/Jettcodey).

> A chaotic shop overhaul where the economy is alive and the furniture is deadly.

## Features

- **Real Time Wave Pricing:** Prices fluctuate up and down constantly based on a sine wave. Time your purchases carefully.
- **Daily Market Events:** Every round features a random economy modifier.
  - *Fire Sale:* 80% off everything.
  - *Hyperinflation:* Prices tripled.
  - *Supply Glut:* Massive stock available.
  - *Drought:* Random items missing entirely.
- **Explosive Shelves:** The extra shelves pulse with cursed colors and have a 1% chance per second to violently explode if you stand too close.
- **Chaotic Stock:** Item limits are randomized every round based on a chaos factor.
- **Infinite Inflation:** Every item you buy increases the price of everything else by 1% for the rest of the run.

## Important

There are a LOT of config entries that allow you to tune the chaos. You can disable the explosions, the wave pricing, or the market events if you want a calmer experience.

## Potential Issues that will be addressed soon

Truck only has 16 upgrades spots, 16 small item spots, 8 large high item spots, 4 large plus item spots, 12 medium item spots, 12 health pack spots, and 4 large item spots.

There is potentially a loss of extra items if you over-purchase during a Supply Glut, but the truck does spawn the "rest" after loading into the next level.
